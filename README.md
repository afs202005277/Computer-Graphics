# Computer Graphics Course Project

This repository holds the source code developed as part of the Computer Graphics course unit. Built with WebGL, it features a variety of scenes and demonstrates the work completed in both the practical classes and the final project.

---

## Project Overview

- **Practical Classes:**  
  The code for each class is organized into folders named `tpX` (where X corresponds to the class number).

- **Final Project:**  
  The final project is housed in the `project` folder, showcasing multiple scenes developed using WebGL.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:afs202005277/Computer-Graphics.git
   ```

2. **Explore the Code:**
   - Browse the `tpX` folders for practical class exercises.
   - Dive into the `project` folder to see the final project in action.

3. **Running the Project:**
   - Ensure you're using a WebGL-compatible browser.
   - Launch a local server (for example, via VSCode's Live Server extension or a similar tool) to run the project files.

## Looking Forward

This repository is built on solid WebGL fundamentals and is primed for growth:
- **Refactoring:** There’s potential to streamline and modularize the code further.
- **Feature Expansion:** New scenes and interactive features can be added to push the boundaries.
- **Performance:** Opportunities exist to optimize rendering and loading times for an even smoother experience.
